That has been badly skewed over the last 100 years due to Progressives such as those now running our government. \n\nOur rights are melting away because Progressives believe the government should control the people rather than how our government was intended.

America's Founders recognized the Fact that the Source of Tyranny was Too much Power in the hands of too few. They created a Government that Limited Power. They wrote a Bill of Rights to give responsible citizens the power they needed to assure their own Liberty.\nThe American Constitution has as its Primary Intent the Prevention of Tyranny and Any law that takes power away from responsible citizen and shifts that power to the Federal Government is likely to be an unconstitutional law.\nNote: Money and property are also considered to be forms of Power.
