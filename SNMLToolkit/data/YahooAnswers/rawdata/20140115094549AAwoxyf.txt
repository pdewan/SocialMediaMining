Your friend would be allowed to give you a book he purchased.  He could not, however, first make a copy of it to keep for himself.  \n\nIf your friend first deleted the game from his computer, he could legally give you the disk he purchased.  Of course, you would not be able to play the game with him.","Timestamp":"1389780472"}]},"Content":"Hi,\nMy problem is that my friend on Steam want me to play with him on Garry's Mod and i want to play too \n:( but unfortunately my dad doesn't trust Steam Services :/ , so i asked him if he can give me a copy of Garry's Mod , he told me that it might be illegal so he won't do it :( , well dah... he gets arrested and i don't want that at all :P , can someone tell me if it's illegal to get that game from his game files ?
