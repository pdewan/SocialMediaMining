Only if a leader was able to see to the welfare of his community, which often as not meant booty from battle, and generosity.\n\nIt is a mistake to learn about the history or culture of the Vikings from a fictional TV show.

We will challenge you, we will kill you and we will put in your place a better leader\" ???\nHow these early leaders of humanity (earls, kings, pharaohs, emperors etc)  foolished the masses to make them think they are supreme, untouchable, god-like???\n","Timestamp":"1389780186","NumAnswers":"3"}
