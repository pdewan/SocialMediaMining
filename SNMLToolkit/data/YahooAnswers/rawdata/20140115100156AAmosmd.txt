Just a Walmart record, so stay out of that store, for a while.   I hope that this serves as a lesson learned and ends your life of crime.   Besides, it doesn't seem that you're a very good shoplifter.","Timestamp":"1389780424"},{"Date":"2014-01-15 10:10:34","UserNick":"PandaGuy","Best":null,"Reference":null,"UserId":"0QZfdCAOaa","Content":"ok 1st off Chill! its not a big deal, when i was 13 i got caught shoplifting with my friends for about 70 dollars (video games) even though ur 19 its no biggie, employers will only ask if you have ever been to jail. how can you have a criminal record if the cops weren't involved... If u did have one they would tell you (the cops would tell you)so that you can prepare yourself for future interviews, relax buddy and walk it off we all do dumb stuff :)","Timestamp":"1389780634"},{"Date":"2014-01-15 10:15:42","UserNick":"Burt.","Best":null,"Reference":null,"UserId":"flkVehA9aa","Content":"Your right to be worried about a criminal record.  A criminal record can completely destroy your life.  Most people have no idea the risk they are taking when they decide to shoplift.  It is much more serious than just getting caught and paying a fine or even a day in jail.  \n\nIt sounds like in your case the Walmart decided not to report to the Police and so you won't have a criminal record this time.  Just don't let it happen again and you will have no problems.","Timestamp":"1389780942"}]},"Content":"???I was killing time ???in Walmart. I wasn't there to buy anything???, but??? I have a long??? ???list of ???things I need for an art class I'm taking at the University so I checked the craft section. They had glue sticks and Sharpies but didn't have exactly what I wanted for the rest so I decided to wait and check a??? ???different store later and buy everything at once. I held on to the glue and markers???, and walked around awkwardly a bit more. I ended up putting them in my pocket. I didn't want to go through the line just for two small things and I didn't want to buy anything I didn't need. I am currently very short on cash, since I am a college student and I am currently out of work due to medical reasons. I also have a lot of traveling and bills because of this medical issue.\n\nI am, in no way, trying to justify myself. I know it was wrong and stupid and I'm definitely never do???ing??? it again. In a way I'm glad I got caught my first time stealing because I will certainly never do it again.\n\nAs I was leaving the store I heard a young woman call \"excuse me\" behind me so I stopped and turned around. Her and two men lead me into the lp room. They told me to put everything I hadn't paid for on the desk, which was less than $5 total. I gave them my id n told them I am 19. They were nice but kept saying how it'd be hard to get a job now. Then they said it was my lucky day and they weren't going to call the cops this time, but if I get caught stealing again, even in another store, then I'll be in big trouble. I was just sitting there, scared out of my mind and trying not to cry. I couldn't really wrap my head around what was going on. What does this mean? Does this mean I have a criminal record? It's on my record for any future employer to see? What would a future employer see, like does it just say \"theft\" or will they see that I only tried to steal less than $5? Will I have to pay a fine???? I live in Maine, if that matters. And as I said, I'm 19 so not a minor. \n\nI've never been in any trouble before and I'm so worried about what this one moment of weakness is going to do to my future.\nThey put all my info into the computer so that even if I get caught, even not at Walmart, they will be able to see that I stole before, that's why I was so worried. \n\nhamel5: Haha, they actually told me I was really bad at it. I guess all that walking in circles, killing time looked suspicious so they actually watched me. Never again.\n","Timestamp":"1389780116","NumAnswers":"3"}
