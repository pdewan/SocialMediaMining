Common sense says most tragedies can be prevented with proper preparations.\n\n>>>The question is not about 9/11. Liberal education has served your reading comprehension very well.\n\nI think your education is the one not served so well.  The point [I believe] was not to talk about 9/11, the point was that many tragedies are preventable, so why are you singling out this one in particular?","Timestamp":"1389779216"},{"Date":"2014-01-15 09:48:18","UserNick":"evilwax","Best":null,"Reference":null,"UserId":"de3b479b4b7be3f89d2662a667efb0d6aa","Content":"9/11 they attack us for our freedoms\nBenghazi, they attack us because of a video\n\nLets ban freedom and videos\n\nLOL at you saying stupidity.

We already acknowledge more should have been done to secure the buildings that were attacked.  However, it doesn't change the fact that our diplomat and his staff were attacked by Islamic fundamentalists, who were not Al Qaeda but were at least partly enraged by a defamatory internet video.  This also does not confirm the false narrative that Republicans have been pushing instead of focusing on how to better protect our diplomats in potentially hostile situations.","Timestamp":"1389779491"},{"Date":"2014-01-15 09:51:40","UserNick":"Lesus","Best":null,"Reference":null,"UserId":"kGAkPJWfaa","Content":"The Iraq war was preventable and it was started because of a false narrative.","Timestamp":"1389779500"},{"Date":"2014-01-15 09:51:54","UserNick":"Death Walking Terror","Best":null,"Reference":null,"UserId":"9e4GLhnlaa","Content":"That is a statement and not a question.\n\nI'm not sure what your point is.","Timestamp":"1389779514"},{"Date":"2014-01-15 09:52:49","UserNick":"Mittens","Best":null,"Reference":null,"UserId":"H4ZLQvLSaa","Content":"You are rewriting rightie talking points, retconning them to make them sound like they agree with the Senate report.
