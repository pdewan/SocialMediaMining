I believe at one point the lowest tax rate in the US was 25%.  Also job growth doesn't equal high paying jobs.  Quantity has nothing to do with quality.\n\nEdit: don't be ridiculous, that is unacceptable.  It is a businesses job to make a profit, and abide by laws that the government has put in place.  I don't hate corporations, or the rich.  I blame the government for their noneffective regulation of our economy.  There is a point at which all classes can prosper but only if we understand that a Corporation exists to increase shareholder wealth and nothing more.  The bottom 20% of wage earners take away slightly over 4.3% of money earned in the US and we have to define what kind of country we want to live in.  Polar extremes at either end of the spectrum aren't better than one another.  They are both unacceptable.  Like any real solution the answer lies somewhat in the middle.","Timestamp":"1389779727"},{"Date":"2014-01-15 09:57:20","UserNick":"IceT","Best":null,"Reference":null,"UserId":"C2HHfun2aa","Content":"You miss one really big important fact!

There were so many loopholes, havens and avoidances with those tax rates that most income those rates would apply to was securely sheltered where the IRS couldn't get at it.\n\nThe only reason the current rate is claimed to be bad is because it has only been in effect for a short time, and almost half of that time has been recessionary or Obama economy (non-recovery). It did not cause any of the recessions (government policy did) nor is there any rational reason to believe that higher marginal tax rates were the cause of previous economic growth.\n\nJose, you will believe any lie that supports your political beliefs.
