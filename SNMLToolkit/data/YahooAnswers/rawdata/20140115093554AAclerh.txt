Is this further proof they don't want this economy to flourish under this Administration?\n\nImmigration Helps American Workers??? Wages and Job Opportunities\n\nImmigrants??? impact on wages\n\nResearch shows that immigration will positively affect U.S. workers??? wages and employment. How can that be? While overly simplistic views of economic theory might suggest that wages will decline in the short run as the supply of labor increases, this is not the case with immigration for two reasons.\n\nFirst, immigrants generally do not have a direct negative impact on the earnings of native-born workers, as native-born workers and immigrant workers generally complement each other rather than compete for the same job. Native-born workers and immigrants tend to have different skill sets and therefore seek different types of jobs. Thus, immigrants are not increasing the labor market competition for native-born workers and therefore do not negatively affect American workers??? earnings.\n\nRead more: http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/immigration/news/2013/08/29/73203/immigration-helps-american-workers-wages-and-job-opportunities/\n","Timestamp":"1389778554","NumAnswers":"19"}
