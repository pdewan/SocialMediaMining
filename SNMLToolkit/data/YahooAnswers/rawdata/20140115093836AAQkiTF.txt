If life doesn't begin at conception, when does it begin?

If it has a heart beat, it's alive. Just stand by your reasoning that it's a woman's right to choose, but to say it isn't alive is a complete lie.","Timestamp":"1389780406"},{"Date":"2014-01-15 10:10:39","UserNick":"0Bama Hawaii","Best":null,"Reference":null,"UserId":"QELttyGaaa","Content":"I guess you could monitor the woman's every move.\n\nIf it happens without any human interaction then it wouldn't be murder would it?\n\nWeird question.","Timestamp":"1389780639"}]},"Content":"will fail to successfully  implant  itself into  the wall of the uterus\nProblem\nWithout  violating  the privacy  of every single  woman  who  has  periods  ,how  to  you  determine if  the failure to implant  was an innocent  act of God or a malicious act of Man ?\n@ u_bin _ ca  \nI'm  opposed  to  elective  abortions past 12 weeks post  conception  \nBut just so  you  know  :88 %  of all abortions happen  before 12  weeks  and < 1.5 %  happen after 20  weeks\n@ Delno \nNo  I couldn't  and  neither  could you \nI've been  with  a lot  of women in my  time and some  of them  had  really  heavy  periods  and  I  couldn't  tell you what  the cause of those heavy  periods were\n","Timestamp":"1389778716","NumAnswers":"12"}
