Vancouver has a lot more in common with California than it does with Edmonton.  The culture is a lot more homogeneous, so don't expect the number of restaurants.  People are a lot more likely to already know people and have their social circles.\n\nThe biggest hurdle is going to be climate and your own attitude.  If you're from California, you view the cold as a holiday in the mountains sort of thing.  You'll also be surprised at what a difference the amount of daylight makes.  You'll have to push yourself to go out rather than hibernating at home with the computer or your game system.  \n\nYou're new in the city, if you don't push yourself to go out, it'll be simpler to just sit at home and wonder why everyone isn't as friendly.  I'd consider keeping a an actual journal of electronic time to make yourself aware of it.   When you're new in a city, it's easy to try and rely on talking with old friends on line, rather than making new ones.\n\nSince this is likely you're first real job, you'll be spending your time on work and with people from work.  That will be a major adjustment.  You'll also find out that the adult world isn't like college where friends come easy.  You'll need to remind yourself to be extroverted, especially when it's cold and grey outside.","Timestamp":"1389781238"}]},"Content":"I am moving from California to Edmonton Alberta for a job.
