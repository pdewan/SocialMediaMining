They delivered one week late, and when delivery came it was a used Sofa that was ripped and damaged, PLUS it wasn't even the one I ORDERED! The sofa was in terrible condition, I went down the shop and had a very bad argument with the salesman and he said he would discount the sofa ??50 off and bring it in great condition the next day and that it was a very bad mistake on their behalf. So I gave them one final chance. The next day is today and the delivery was not made and no one is picking up the phone. Today they brought the WRONG SOFA AGAIN! They seem to not like refunding the money, as they keep pushing back the due date! \n\nIs there a possibility I could inform the police? As I cannot sit on the sofas, I have to put the dog in my friends house so he doesn't jump on it, and they refuse to take it and refund today, even though they promise to. My mother is under immense stress as is my dad and so am I. \n\nWill the police be any help?\n\nAny help will be taken with gratitude. \nThanks!\nAlso to add, they just leave there sofas in my house  and just ignore us. They are sending random men who are trespassing leaving unwanted items in my house.\n","Timestamp":"1389779039","NumAnswers":"1"}
