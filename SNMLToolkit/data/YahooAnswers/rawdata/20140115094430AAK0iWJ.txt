I want to go into the army, but I'm not sure what I want to do. The recruiter said once I turn 17 I can go into national guard, and then once I graduate I can ship out for basic whenever I want and go active. Does anyone know about this? Also, is my score good or bad? I'm a perfectionist, and it's really bothering me to not have a set scale of what's a good score. Please help!\n","Timestamp":"1389779070","NumAnswers":"2"}
