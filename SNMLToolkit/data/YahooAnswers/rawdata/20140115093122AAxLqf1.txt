What is she supervising?  Why is he not allowed to ask questions?  (Why is this a violation?)  What's wrong with her writing notes?  Are the boys his kids too?  If so why does he have rights with all his arrests and an RO against him?  Maybe you should re-write the question to get better answers.  :)","Timestamp":"1389778742"},{"Date":"2014-01-15 09:40:16","UserNick":"Jay","Best":null,"Reference":null,"UserId":"3tuwWidiaa","Content":"Why?  Because she's either lazy, confused about how to do her \"job\" properly, or dishonest.\n\nYou could try \"coaching\" her, to see if it really is just confusion.  But if that fails... or you just don't want to invest the time... I fail to see why you wouldn't replace her?  If it's up to you, is there some restriction on you replacing?\n\nUPDATE: \"Here's additional info, SINCE AGAIN, I didn't get \"answers\"\"\n\nYou're not getting answers because you aren't asking a clear question.\n\nI thought you were asking \"WHY is she doing this?\"  I responded to this.\n\nYou asked \"Should I ban her from supervising?\"  I responded to this.\n\nYour followup was a rant.  One that you are well entitled to, given your situation.  But instead of being mad at us or giving details about your ex, you need to get down to what exactly is your question.  If it's \"should I replace to supervisor, given that she's not acting properly,\" the answer is \"yes.\"","Timestamp":"1389778816"}]},"Content":"A woman that I refereed my EX to in order to have a professional supervisor is NOT doing her job CORRECTLY, or at least NOT ethically in my OPINION.\n\nHere's the short version, PLEASE READ IT ALL BEFORE REPLYING AND SAYING THINGS THAT ARE NOT FACTUAL.\n\nEx has been arrested 78 times, in 7 states, he's plead guilty to violating the Restraining Order I have against him 3 times, including 2 times last month.\n\nThe court order says ANYONE I APPROVE can supervise, I agreed to the Professional because I BELIEVED SHE WOULD NOT BE MANIPULATED BY HIM.\n\nThere is NO court order asking for \"notes\" of visitation, yet, my EX ask her for notes, whenever he tries to \"take me to court\"-the NOTES LEAVE OUT IMPORTANT aspects.\n\nAspects like EX violating R.O. and CREEPILY watching me from parking lot, and waving at me, and him sitting behind her office to watch us thru the window.\n\nMORE IMPORTANTLY, her NOTES DO LIST MULTIPLE violations WHERE MY EX has ASKED MY SONS ABOUT ME (VIOLATION OF THE RESTRAINING ORDER) and she WRITES in the NOTES the CRAP he ask and the BOYS response.\n\nShe HAS done this on more than one visit, and IT is attempting to make me look BAD. \n\nWHY is she doing this? I am allowed to approve anyone, I have asked her to INFORM me the DAY HE violates so I can REPORT him then RATHER THAN MONTHS LATER.\n\nShould I ban her from supervising? What SHOULD I do? \n Please HELP, MANY THANKS!\nHere's additional info, SINCE AGAIN, I didn't get \"answers\"-she's supervising visitation, he has supervised visitation and I am the SOLE custodial parent (and ALWAYS have been), he's not in jail because he's smart and 78 arrest SPAN across 7 states. There is no restrictions on who supervises, it's written in the order as who I \"approve\".\nHE IS NOT ALLOWED TO ASK ANYONE ABOUT ME, OR TO BE NEAR ME, OR AT MY SCHOOL/HOUSE ET CETRA-ALSO, HE'S NOT ALLOWED TO CYBER STALK ME OR RECORD ME OR ANYTHING. THE SUPERVISOR BELIEVES I TALK TO HIM BECAUSE HE TOLD HER SO IN SEPT. IT'S NOW JAN. AND I THINK SHE FINALLY REALIZES HE HAS LIED TO HER. BUT, honestly, I think she is totally BLINDED by EX, who is a PROFESSIONAL ACTOR! Seriously!!!\n","Timestamp":"1389778283","NumAnswers":"2"}
