On the predictions of Nostradamus?  On the paranormal abilities of that universal seer, Glenn Beck?\n\nI don't have your abilities, I guess.  To answer your question, I'd guess that Obama will retire at the end of his term with seeming humility.\n\nThen when American capitalism really starts to collapse due to the swelling population of desperate poor people under the new GOP administration, or when the Wall Street financial sector crashes again, or when much of the country is ravaged by unusual wildfires & droughts thanks to GOP foot-dragging on climate change -- in short, when our entire society seems locked in a dangerous crisis -- THEN Obama may declare himself dictator.\n\nBut only then, because he couldn't get away with this except under the conditions of a national emergency.\n\nActually, I kind of suspect he won't try for dictatorship at all.  \n\nLike almost every other ex-president of recent years, I believe Obama will set up his own presidential library and his own nonprofit foundation, then go on speaking tours around the country where corporate investors will pay him $20,000 per appearance, just for sharing his knowledge about how Washington DC really works.\n\nOr maybe he'll bow out of politics entirely and take up oil painting or watercolors, in order to express himself that way.  Maybe he'll go on to teach constitutional law for a high salary at Harvard or Columbia, where students will flock to his lectures on the constitutionality of NSA spying and predator drone assassinations of suspected Muslim extremists.\n\nBut my guess is that he'll set up a lucrative non-profit foundation and go on speaking tours, or possibly become an enormously well-paid corporate or non-corporate consultant with a big Washington DC lobbying firm.\n\nIf Obama ever does become dictator, however, I'll try to remind him of your name.  :-)","Timestamp":"1389780674"},{"Date":"2014-01-15 10:11:52","UserNick":"Armchair Goddess #1","Best":null,"Reference":null,"UserId":"mPOhFxubaa","Content":"You might have been in a coma during the 2008 and 2012 campaign cycles, but our recession-reversing, nation-saving, economy-growing, revenues-generating, jobs-creating, auto-industry-rescuing, middle-class-strengthening, manufacturing-jobs-base-rebuilding (see recovery.gov), deficit-slashing, Iraq-war-ending, bin-Laden-getting, sea-captain-freeing (from Somali pirates), defense-contractors-auditing, VA-medical-facilities-funding, disaster-relief-expediting, grieving-Americans-comforting, marriage-equality-endorsing, Syrian-disarmament-deal-brokering, Middle-East-peace-process-overseeing, highly intelligent, deeply patriotic, and incredibly patient President Obama was VOTED INTO OFFICE by we, the American people, twice---and by a LANDSLIDE victory.

We remember the near-fatal damages the GOP did from 2001 through to 2009 with your always-fail GOP policies of deregulation (bank failures, insurers' greed, corporate corruption), outsourcing of American jobs, and the \"trickle on down up the little people\" obscenity of supply-side (Republican) economics that leads to DEPRESSION every time it is used.","Timestamp":"1389780712"},{"Date":"2014-01-15 10:15:05","UserNick":"????????M?????????","Best":null,"Reference":null,"UserId":"089e8d35b7463b74daf5b60e025ccdc5aa","Content":"You seem to have very little faith in our Constitution and its value in protecting us.
