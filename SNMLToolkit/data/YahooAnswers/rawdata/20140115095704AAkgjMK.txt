The court is not going to sue... the parent sues and the court rules. \nNormally the legal standard is that the father is liable only when there is a legitimate order. Not only did she not file, she \"left\", and apparently she didn't notify you where she was.  Seems like she would have an arugument if it was him that moved, and she was unable to file.  \nI have heard of some courts trying to order retroactively, but it would sure sound irrational if they did in this case.  All you can do in court is testify as to what the facts are/were and go from there.","Timestamp":"1389781628"}},"Content":"When my husband and I started dating we found out his ex was a couple months pregnant. His daughter is now 5. He signed the birth certificate, we helped out the first 2 years until she got mad and just left with the child. Now she's back in our lives, they're waiting on a date to get with a mediator. I really  need to know the likelihood of him being sued for back support. There was NO prior order. I know it's his pain and on him that he never pursued this until now, but she never pursued it, said don't go through courts, just help when you can. Okay, we thought naively. Now we have no proof we helped and he pretty much looks like a dead beat dad especially the way she's painting him out to be. We have 3 kids of our own now and we have absolutely no qualms helping, but for 2 years (not our choice) we had no contact and I'm hoping we don't have to pay an entire 5 years of back support especially when there was no court proceedings prior to this.\n","Timestamp":"1389779824","NumAnswers":"1"}
