It's annoying, as I'm not a thief. I don't even know these people, so how fo they know me? I went on this board to help people with their problems, who have had similiar experiences to what I've been through in yjr past, such as depression. If I hadn't gone through that myself, I wouldn't know how to advise them, unless I was a psychologist. If certain people wont put into practice things I suggest that have worked for me, then how would they know whether they work or not. I don't appreciate it when someone puts me down in a song, who haven't gone through experiences like depression, the lalala song, not sure of the name, it's not that great a song to bother looking it up. But it's well for some people having success in life, when most of the rest of us don't and are struggling with these problems.\n","Timestamp":"1389778573","NumAnswers":"1"}
