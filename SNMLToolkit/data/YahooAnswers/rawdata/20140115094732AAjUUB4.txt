I went through a terrible appeal process, and was accepted for benefits. Currently I am one of those that lost benefits as of 12/28/2013 because my claim was now considered to be Emergency Unemployment Compensation (EUC) which the state (or country?) ended. I was enrolled in school full-time during the fall semester and I am about to start my spring semester, but I don't know if I qualify for ABT since I am a full-time student and I currently still have an active claim although my benefits are over with (for now). I know it's a confusing situation, but my only question is: Am I automatically disqualified from ABT because of my original denied claim for unemployment? \n\n\nIt's so difficult to get in touch with people who know these things, especially for some of the miserable people who work at the unemployment phone centers or where ever they pick up from. So I do apologize for even asking, but some of those people aren't really there to help. I can only imagine everyone else's situation. \n\nAnyway, Thanks so much. in advance.\n","Timestamp":"1389779252","NumAnswers":"1"}
